 Workflow 1: First-Time Memory Bank Setup

  This workflow is triggered automatically if the .memory_bank directory is missing. The goal is to create the core files by guiding the user through a friendly, conversational interview.

  Example Interaction Flow:

   1. AI Acknowledges the Need:
      > "Hello! It looks like we haven't worked on this project together before. To keep track of our work effectively, I need to create a .memory_bank. This will help me remember the
  project's goals and our progress between sessions.
      >
      > "Do you have a moment to answer a few quick questions to set it up?"

   2. AI Asks Questions Sequentially: The AI will ask for one piece of information at a time, creating each file as it goes.
       * For `projectbrief.md`: "Great. Let's start with the project brief. In a sentence or two, what is the main goal of this project?"
       * For `techContext.md`: (The AI can pre-fill this by checking files like package.json or requirements.txt) "Thanks. I've detected a package.json file, so I'll note that we're using
         Node.js and Next.js. Is there any other key technology or tool I should be aware of?"
       * For `productContext.md`: "Perfect. Now, who is this project for, and what problem does it solve for them?"
       * For `systemPatterns.md`: "Got it. Could you briefly describe the system's architecture? For example, is it a web app, a mobile app, a library, etc.?"
       * For `progress.md` & `activeContext.md`: "Excellent. Lastly, what is the current status of the project, and what is the very first task you'd like me to work on?"

   3. AI Confirms Completion:
      > "Thank you! The memory bank is now set up. I'm ready to start on our first task."

  Workflow 2: Updating the Memory Bank

  This workflow keeps the project context current.

   * Trigger: The user gives a direct command like "update the memory bank" or "let's save our progress."
   * AI Action:
       1. The AI will immediately stop its current work.
       2. It will re-read all files in the .memory_bank to ensure it has the absolute latest version.
       3. It will synthesize the conversation and any code changes since the last update.
       4. It will intelligently update the files, primarily focusing on activeContext.md (what we're doing now) and progress.md (what we've done).
       5. The AI confirms the update: "I've updated the memory bank with our latest progress and decisions."

  This system ensures that the AI is always synchronized with the project's state in a way that feels natural and collaborative for the user.
