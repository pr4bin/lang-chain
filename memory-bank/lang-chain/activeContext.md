The project has been significantly refactored into a modular and scalable structure. It now features a central, interactive menu in `main.py` for running all examples. Key dependencies like `langchain` and `langchain-community` have been upgraded and resolved. The immediate next step is for the user to test the new menu-driven interface to ensure all refactored examples run correctly.
