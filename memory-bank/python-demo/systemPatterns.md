# System Patterns for python-demo

The project will be structured as a modular application, likely managed through a central command-line interface (CLI).

- Each major topic (e.g., RAG, fine-tuning, vector databases) will be organized into its own Python module or script.
- This allows for clear separation of concerns and makes it easy to run individual experiments.
