# System Patterns for nextjs-mastery

This project follows the standard architectural patterns of a Next.js application:

- **File-based Routing:** Routes are defined by the structure of the `app` directory.
- **Server Components:** Utilizes React Server Components for server-side rendering by default.
- **API Routes:** Serverless functions can be created within the `app/api` directory.

Future architectural decisions have not yet been made.
